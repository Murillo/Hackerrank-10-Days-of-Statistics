# Question: A large elevator can transport a maximum of 9800 pounds. Suppose a
# load of cargo containing 49 boxes must be transported via the elevator.
# The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean
# of u = 205 pounds and a standard deviation of a = 15 pounds. Based on this
# information, what is the probability that all 49 boxes can be safely loaded
# into the freight elevator and transported?
